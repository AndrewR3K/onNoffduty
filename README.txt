This is a simple easily configurable on and off duty script for VORP Core framework.

It works via 2 commands /goingonduty and /goingoffduty when you do /goingonduty if you have the offduty job set in the config it changes your job to the onduty job and vice versa. If you are already on or off duty when you use a command it will tell you.

This script is useful for setting up jobs that you want to recieve a paycheck only when they are on duty.

It does require VORP Core to work.

Easy to install just add 'ensure onNoffduty' in your resource.cfg

You can have as many jobs configured as youd like.
